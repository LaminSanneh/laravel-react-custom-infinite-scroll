# [Laravel](https://laravel.com), [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) Project for infinite scroll system

## Brief description
Even though laravel comes bundled with Laravel mix, I decided not to use it. I created a custom webpack configuration to work with assets. 
In this project, we create a simple infinite scroll system using recact in frontend and laravel in backend.

## To Initilize

First run:
```
npm install
```

Then run:
```
composer install
```

Add a .env file (you can copy the one from .env.example)

Run `php artisan key:generate`

Finally run laravel as you normally do. Either ```php artisan serve``` or use a dedicated server to host the application.
