# [Laravel](laravel.com), [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) Project for infinite scroll system

## Brief description
Even though laravel comes bundled with Laravel mix, I decided not to use it. I created a custom webpack configuration to work with assets.

## To Initilize

First run:
```
npm install
```

Then run:
```
composer install
```

Finally run laravel as you normally do. Either ```php artisan serve``` or use a dedicated server to host the application.
